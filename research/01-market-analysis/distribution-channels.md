## Risk Mitigation

### Reddit Bans
- **Risk**: Permanent subreddit ban for self-promotion
- **Mitigation**: Only use designated self-promo threads, build karma first
- **Red flags**: Multiple posts about same product, no comment history

### Community Backlash
- **Risk**: "Another fitness app" skepticism
- **Mitigation**: Lead with user research, show you understand pain points
- **Positioning**: "Built from 734 comments on your favorite channels"

### Low Conversion
- **Risk**: Reddit users resistant to paid products
- **Mitigation**: Offer generous free tier, highlight transformation results
- **Fallback**: Use for feedback, not just sales

## Metrics to Track

**Reddit Engagement**
- Post karma scores
- Comment conversion to DMs
- Traffic from Reddit to landing page

**Discord Engagement**
- Server join rate
- DM inquiries
- Voice chat participation

**Beta Signups**
- Source tracking (which subreddit/Discord)

2. What's the average response rate in r/fitness app megathreads?
