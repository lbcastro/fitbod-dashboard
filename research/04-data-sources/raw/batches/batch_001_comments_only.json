      "text": "Good stuff, appreciate your videos! However I don't think the wrist roller trains the opposite muscles (wrist extension in your example) on the way down, since your resistance is still in the same direction; the only difference is that on the way down it's resisting the weight falling down instead of bringing it up. It's just like the eccentric of a push up, which doesn't make it a pull exercise; it still uses the same muscles as the concentric. To turn the wrist roller into a wrist extension exercise you have to turn it around, so that the band hangs from the other side of the bar. Right?\n\nI also like to train wrist radial and ulnar deviation (with a stick with weight on one end) as well as wrist pronation and supination (with something like a judo belt with weight plates hanging from it) and dumbbell finger rolls. As a climber I feel like this could help a lot in injury prevention.",

      "text": "Amazing stuff man, I do have a question though. Do you do any body weight stuff during the week? Like 50 push ups every morning, etc? Or just the lifts? Should your chest be so sore you can't do push ups througout the week? Becuase if im hitting chest once a week hard (which I agree with) is it gonna hurt to add some body weight just to have something to do exercise wise during the week to help me wake up / stimulate my muscles? Hopefully that makes sense! This question could also apply to things like body weight squats, arm curls, etc. Movements that people have historically added to their daily routine.",

Neck can one of the most injury prone areas in my opinion.",

Before that i started walking and some cardio.\nIm slowly getting stronger and slowly lose fat but also gain muscle.\nCan do a full set of pushups now and probably can do my first pullup soon too.\nThis was impossible for me before i started. I didnt exercise at all.\n\nConsistency just works, but it is slow. And if things slow down, i probably only need to change something small and continue.\nYou know what sucks most about this? There is no magic. \n\nNo special thing that makes this faster (without extreme drawbacks).\nNo \"hack\" that makes it easier.\nNo Supplement that makes this effortless.\n\nThere is no shortcut. \"Keep it simple stupid\". \nFrom my experience, which isnt too much yet but still,\nstart with something. Even \"just\" walking will do a lot for you. And then slowly add more to it over time.",

      "text": "Hey awesome video, my only question is how many sets should I do? I've been doing 2 sets to failure on every exercise for a while now, but should I do more sets for compounds and less sets for isolation? For example, 4 sets of bench press and 2 set of lateral raises. Or am I overthinking and 2 sets for every exercise is totally fine as long as each one is pushed to failure. I have this concept in my mind that spamming sets on isolation exercises is pointless, but doing more sets on compound lifts is worth it because of the additional muscles being activated. Thanks anyway, very helpful video.",

The ease of this workout i like as i also do shift work. Only question is my legs are one area where id love them to grow, would the UL split do that hitting legs once a week? Would a 3 day full body be more beneficial? Many thanks for all your help and brilliant no BS content too",

      "text": "I started training in 1978 when I was 14. Two years before that, I threw out my back shanking a punt during football\u2014ended up with spondylolisthesis in my L5-S1. Doctors told me not to lift, said it would make it worse. My back was so unreliable I\u2019d often sit out gym class, until an 8th grade teacher warned me I wouldn\u2019t get away with that in high school.\n\nEverything changed when my youth football coach\u2019s son took me down to their basement and showed me his barbell set. I tried a bench press, then a curl\u201495 lbs. on each, sloppy as hell, but I got them up. I was hooked. Got my own barbell set the following Christmas.\n\nMy goal wasn\u2019t to get big\u2014it was to get strong. All I had to go by was the wall chart that came with my 110 lb. Diversified Products set from Sears (where my dad worked) -- cement inside with a plastic coating.  I followed it religiously. And I got strong\u2014even more once I got an adjustable bench w/leg extension the next year.\n\nBut something else happened. I hit my growth spurt hard. Between freshman and sophomore year, I went from 108 lbs. to 162 lbs. People noticed. Friends asked about my bench, teachers told me I looked good. That\u2019s when I got serious\u2014books, a chin-up bar in my doorway,  learning about diet. The muscle came as a byproduct of getting stronger.\n\nI never looked back. Never had interest in stepping on a bodybuilding stage\u2014not even once. But I did turn it into a career as a pro wrestler. That strength paid off in other ways too, like working as a land surveyor and being able to remove 230 lb. manhole covers by myself, one-handed.\n\nEventually, you realize you can only grow so much. The rest of the journey is about holding onto what you\u2019ve built\u2014and fighting like hell not to lose it.",

If your sets are hard enough, you don\u2019t need to track every weight, but noting your main lifts once a month is a good way to check if you\u2019re truly progressing.\n\nMuscles don\u2019t see numbers\u2014they respond to hard work and progressive overload. Tracking can make linear progression easier, but if you push all sets to failure, your body will naturally adapt and you\u2019ll increase weight intuitively over time.\n\nBad intuitive training is what you described in the video: training comfortably, constantly changing exercises, chasing pump. That leads to minimal gains.\n\nGood intuitive training, on the other hand, is hard, structured, and consistent. If you listen to your body, train hard, and track main lifts occasionally, you don\u2019t need to log every set.\n\nTracking everything can be useful, especially for beginners, but the key is finding the right approach for yourself. Some people thrive on high volume, some on lower volume. Some succeed purely intuitively, others with detailed tracking. There is no universal optimal method.\n\nTraining smart and hard is the universal key to your dream body.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your opinion on this because I\u2019m always learning and could be wrong. Love your channel\u2014it helps people stop wasting time in the gym and start training really hard instead of just long.\n\nTake care, brother!",

      "text": "A common problem in assessing progress is switching around the workouts so often that it becomes impossible to know whether or not you're getting stronger. And make no mistake, STRENGTH is the goal. Judging progress based on body weight will only incentivize weight gain. But the rate of muscle growth is too slow to be useful here. If you are getting measurably stronger on each workout (or nearly so), then muscle growth WILL follow. Now, once you're focused on getting more reps with more weight, then a second common problem arises. You must perform the same exercises for an extend period as mentioned previously, but YOU ALSO MUST maintain the same form and rep cadence. If you are going slow, smooth, and strict one week, but you up the weight and start slinging the weight to get your reps, then are you getting stronger? PROBABLY NOT. You have to keep all the parameters constant in order to assess progress. The only things that should change are the # reps and resistance used. This is how you KNOW you are making progress. \"The first principle is that you must not fool yourself - and you are the easiest person to fool.\" Richard Feynman",

Channels like yours and getting help from my gym buds made me totally consistent the past 15 weeks. I keep things simple, track my workouts, and built an easy nutrition plan. The results are insane.

      "text": "48 years of training and I do none of this -- except hang on a chin bar and light stretching of the pecs, shoulders and lats. I jump right in to my heaviest set. Then knock off 10% each subsequent set. Example: This morning I walked into the gym at 7:50 AM, hung from the chin bar for 30 seconds, did my pre-workout stretch, then went for my first set of seated cable rows: 210 lbs. for 7 reps, then 190 for 8 reps on the second set; 170 for 9 reps on the third set. Heavy to light gets your heaviest weight when the muscle is fresh, making the lighter poundages harder in the sets after. \n\nWalking on a treadmill or a stair stepper has never worked for me as a warm-up.  I do that separately, as well as stretch post-workout which includes band work. I get my mind ready in the shower and on the way to the gym. This works for me.\n\nAs Vince Gironda said, \"Your first set is your warmup set.\" There are no such things as \"warm up sets\", \"ramping sets\" or \"work sets\". That's gimmickry and \"bro science\". I hate that phrase.  EVERY SET YOU DO IS A WORK SET.",

But you cannot beat going through a full range of motion, with weight to improve your mobility. \n\nMost days I've been out walking for 45 mins or so before I lift, a walk really does \"get you moving\" \n\n\ud83d\ude4f",

I wanted to know that how can I add cardio in all this, I add running in my routine so can it be that I lift 4 days and then in the rest 3 days, I give for running?? Does that become 6 days workout week?? My main problem is, If I don't get a good workout and get to move my body, I don't feel good. It opens up my brain and mood. So yes I can Incorporate 4 day lift per week, but what about the rest days? I'm interested in martial arts, Calisthenics and running....",

The usual range is 1.2-1.6...) and companies selling protein pudding really aren't part of the fitness industry, they're just commerce being commerce. They're selling you vegan water as well but nobody sane is gonna pretend like they're part of some vegan movement. Listening to nutritionists giving you average numbers for the general population is also wrong because they're giving you numbers for sustaining a healthy life with some light to moderate fitness like 2 runs a week.\n\nYes, the industry is wrong for most people because it takes a ceiling for the 5% and pretends like every average lifter needs to go there. But there's no need to reach like that. Throwing the pendulum the other way helps no one.",

Only eating 95% carbs and training hard as f*ck. when i was walking back home, i used to stop at a dunking donuts store and buy a box of  six donuts and walk back home eating it. When i got home, used to eat 6 french breads with butter and jelly and drink a liter of milk, was never a great protein eater, used to eat one chicken beef ta lunch. Now i'm 48 and have 85kg, 43kg of muscle and around 12-15% of boddy fat. All because of what i built in that time. And i'm still eating loads of carbs, and the bare minimum of protein.

I used to injest liquid amino acids combined with a mineral supplement of calcium and magnesium with yogurt an hour before training.  Avoided long digestion times and worked quickly in increasing my lifting strength. Any amount over is either stored or depleted....and there are still some medical professionals claiming the controversial opinion that high animal protein damages kidneys. Carbs are very important for the energy required for lifting and for filling out your muscles. Notice how huge your muscles look the day after you lift. Carbs retain water-muscles mostly water.",

To seek out meals that would total 140g of protein per 24hrs is still being very \"protein thinking\". So I don't really get what the big lie is? It's already extremely well established that we need protein to repair and grow muscle...and you seek out 140g per day. I think if you are saying that you don't need the sometimes suggested 1g per 1b of bodyweight and that 0.6g to 0.8g per lb is sufficient, then yes that's fine.

I\u2019ve been following this same routine 3\u20134 times a week for the past six years, while keeping my diet and sleep consistent, and I couldn\u2019t agree more with what you\u2019re saying. Over time, you really start to see how powerful the basics are. It\u2019s not about chasing new programs or doing anything extreme\u2014it\u2019s about mastering the fundamentals and sticking with them. Some weeks the progress is obvious, other weeks it\u2019s subtle, but it\u2019s always adding up in the background. That long-term consistency builds not just physical results, but discipline and confidence too. Six years in, it\u2019s clear that showing up regularly and trusting the process beats any short-term motivation. Consistency really is the key! \ud83e\uddbe",

People want instant results rather than long term progress. I do get it though. I went from bodyweight dips to adding 45 lbs for 8 reps a year later and I didnt look any bigger but I clearly was stronger. It's part of the reason I quit the gym for a while. Between the cost, the weather and just not seeing the physical mass development I wanted I was less inclined to keep going to the gym.",

Low effort my ass. \nNot to mention you're saying we don't need to spend 2 hours in the gym to get results, then pivot to spending 2 hours walking. Fantastic.",

If you don\u2019t have fun while at the gym then you don\u2019t need to go there and you do it just because of the hype around fitness. I personally found out that I have fun when running and hiking and that\u2019s all I\u2019m doing, and also some body weight exercises that I like. Pumping iron was not for me even though I have good genetics. It\u2019s probably weird to see a big guy with wide shoulders like me to run a lot but it\u2019s so fun for me that I can\u2019t help it lol",
