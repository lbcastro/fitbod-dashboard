          "text": "Excellent analysis! When I trained back in the late 70s and 80s, everyone in the gym was doing similar workouts because we all read the same magazines. We did what worked for the champions at that time. Here are the reasons why old-school bodybuilders looked better, including some that were mentioned:\r\n1. Sunlight increased muscle tone. See the video \"THE SUN CURE - Restoring The Lost Art of Light As Medicine\"\r\n2. Ribcage expansion work built large, Herculean thoraxes.\r\n3. Serious, high-rep and set ab workouts, multiple times per week, made the waist muscles small, and tight. This made the shoulders look wider. The ab routine in Arnold's book \"Education of a Bodybuilder\" was 5 x 50 reps each for Incline Situps, Lying Leg Raises, and Broom-stick Twists.\r\n4. Big calves! Standing, seated, and donkey calf raises, 5 X 15 reps, multiple times per week. \r\n5. Lats sweeping down all the way down to the waist from full-range (leaning WAY forward) cable rows and T-bar rows. Also barbell rows with the back parallel to the floor, standing on a block, letting the bar all the way down to the toes!\r\n6. Stretching between sets making the muscles long and graceful looking, especially the lats and chest.\r\n7. Wide grip chins behind-the-neck were very common. They stretch the ligaments of the shoulder blades, making for a wider front and rear lat spread.\r\n8. Shorter rest periods with reps in the 8-12 range. When Arnold arrived from Europe at Gold's, he called it training \"California Style\" with only 1-min rest for smaller muscle groups like shoulder, arms, calves, and forearms; 1.5 min for chest, back and legs.",

Taxi drivers, construction worker, security guards, laborers yet they're the most jacked especially for their old age. They give the most ridiculous advise and programs.\n\nBut why are they still jacked and in shape?\n\nConsistency. \n\nMost of these men only had access to one or two copies of  a bodybuilding magazine, most of them probably saw one or few training routines and just stick with it their entire lives, meanwhile most of us new lifters overcomplicate and get baited by the latest study the latest program our attention spans are too short.\n\nAnd why were they so jacked despite having little to no equipment because they make the most out of it.\n\nI've seen guys in poor gyms have better bodies that dudes who can afford commercial gyms. They train in scarcity, they make the best out of it. Meanwhile dudes in commercial gyms have wifis and are glues to their phones or too bored in their gyms they just try each equipment and hop from one machine to another.\n\nI used to be this guy. Now I've seen the most progress by simplifying anything. Went full body 3x a week, 2-3 working sets 5-6 reps (if I can do 8 then I add weight until I can 5-6 reps max again)",

The photographers didnt  just appreciate the beauty of the male aesthetic, they saw it as a symbol of the greatness of mankind. Specificaly the great men of the West who built the modern world. Their photographs  inspired young men to not develop their bodies for narcissistic pleasure but  to pursue greatness in everything they do. To build a world of prosperity and freedom for all. They inspired boys to see manhood as a time to prepare for, to get big and strong in order to serve  something greater than themselves,  to defend the weak, to build community, to defend country, to worship God. It was a time of patriarchy.   Today anyone with a phone can publishing photographs, usually focusing on crass, extreme fetish,  or overt narcissistic self worship and false idolotry. Today's images reflect the feminist destruction of patriarchy and their attack on men through systematic weakening and blurring the lines of gender roles. The feminization of everything has caused division and confusion rather than inclusion and unity. Matriarchy, the radical far left kind, seeks to destroy everything created by patriarchy, including  art and the portrayals of men in art.",

Knowing what works for you and what you can recover from, is way more applicable to you than knowing the details of this or that niche exercise.\n\nThe basics get you 95%, the science makes that clear. Reasonable people can argue on optimising the last 5%, but until you get the 95% dialed in, don't worry about those last details.",

My inflammation and back aches are gone (had 2 back surgeries), feel tons better, sleep rhythm is great, excess energy, put on muscle much easier, no mood swings, and my skin looks better. Went back to visit old friends this week and have already gotten several comments about looking younger and healthier. We all need to go back to basic ancestral foods without labels. Organic meat, eggs, fruit and vegetables, thats it. Get what you can from local farms and markets. Videos like this is the real deal guys, you can do it!",

Also 8 or 9 eggs a week and of course hydration, 2 to 3 litres a day. I am 5' 9\"  170 pounds with 12 % body fat. I workout 3 days a week and play hockey one a week. It is so simple but not easy.

And then on top its organic... That you are consuming every day.. must cost serious £££.\nAlso and Im not being sarcy, you must spend hours prepping, and cooking that food each day.

          "text": "Hey @averagetojacked, I found your channel recently and really like the approach. For context, I'm a 39 year old guy living in Switzerland who has been lifting for about 10 years. I'm 88kg (180cm in height) and fairly muscular - at least enough that people seem to remark on it when meeting me, etc.\n\nThe problem is, I have little kids now. My workout used to be 2 hours per day, 5 days per week. That's now impossible. I've slowly reduced the number of days per week, and number of sets per exercise slowly over the last few years (all before discovering your channel). I'm now at 3 sets per body exercise. So, 3 sets of incline bench, 3 sets of dips, etc etc. I ALWAYS go to failure, to the point where my form gives out and on some exercises I feel sick. I trust I'm really pushing it for each set.\n\nHowever, my workouts are still a solid 1.5 hours, abeit now only 4 days per week. I arrive at the gym at 04:45 every morning so that I can finish before my kids wake up. But it's very very exhausting after several years of this, plus a full time job of course.\n\nI started watching your content recently, and I would love to change to your method — if only so that I could reduce wayyyy down on my workout times. However, if I'm really honest, I'm just scared that if I go down to ONE SET per exercise (😱) I'm going to lose all the gains I've built up over the past 10 years.\n\nEven if I just go down to 2 sets per exercise would save me so much time. I can't imagine doing 1 set per exercise.\n\nCan you say anything to reassure me that it will work and I won't lose everything?",

I very, very stubbornly decided to stick to Mike Mentzer's final (thin）book while at barely 30% of my genetic potential - for year and year and never progressed. That was working out legs every 4 to 5 days once. It does not work, you do not progress. I started seeing progress again when I started doing his split routine DAILY for 4-5 days in row and inserting 2 or 3 days off after. Those of us who barely have any muscle cannot get stronger with such infrequent single set 20 minute workouts IMO. I have no idea why Mike Mentzer didn't know this, I think because he NEVER would have trained someone who was a beginner, everyone he was dealing with had so much muscle mass they really did need the recovery days. I'm just saying this because I was off-track for about 5 years.",

You can just look back at his history/pipeline of \"i tried x for x months - you can buy my program down below in the description\". It's every time he releases a program. I'm sure hes a nice enough guy, but his content and programs are just slop thrown together using \"science based\" as a sales pitch. Jeff has a track record of interpreting data incorrectly and just running off of the most recent study shows \"x result in x trainees\". It's science for toddlers and beginners who don't understand what hes doing, because those people are easy to sell cheap shitty programs to.\n\nBro lifters worked this shit out decades ago",

A cheat code in life can mean something completely different for everyone.\nMany things can help you in life in general. Being born super rich, looking reat, having mental health and lots of other things are just as, or even more \"helpful\" in whatever you want to archieve. \n\nHeck, for my part i would be happy not being disabled. Just being normal would be more than enough. That would be MY ultimate cheat code in life. Being jacked would \"just\" be the icing on the cake, to be honest.🙂",

I am trying to change up my workout routine and if you have a video on here about a routine I’d like to watch it. I’ll keep looking and see if I can find it on your page. 🙏🏼 🌳",

So I want to probably do ramping sets. So I want to probably do two<00:02:49.599><c> to</c><00:02:49.760><c> three</c><00:02:50.000><c> ramping</c><00:02:50.400><c> sets,</c><00:02:50.879><c> rest</c><00:02:51.120><c> a</c><00:02:51.360><c> full</c> two to three ramping sets, rest a full two to three ramping sets, rest a full two<00:02:51.760><c> to</c><00:02:51.920><c> three</c><00:02:52.160><c> minutes,</c><00:02:52.800><c> and</c><00:02:53.040><c> then</c><00:02:53.200><c> jump</c><00:02:53.440><c> into</c> two to three minutes, and then jump into two to three minutes, and then jump into my<00:02:53.920><c> first</c><00:02:54.160><c> working</c><00:02:54.560><c> set.</c><00:02:55.120><c> And</c><00:02:55.280><c> the</c><00:02:55.599><c> main</c><00:02:55.920><c> goal</c> my first working set. And the main goal my first working set. And the main goal with<00:02:56.480><c> my</c><00:02:56.720><c> working</c><00:02:57.040><c> set</c><00:02:57.360><c> is</c><00:02:57.519><c> to</c><00:02:57.760><c> push</c><00:02:58.080><c> myself</c><00:02:58.400><c> to</c> with my working set is to push myself to with my working set is to push myself to the<00:02:58.800><c> bleeding</c><00:02:59.200><c> edge</c><00:02:59.840><c> and</c><00:03:00.080><c> aiming</c><00:03:00.480><c> to</c><00:03:00.800><c> beat</c><00:03:01.120><c> my</c> the bleeding edge and aiming to beat my the bleeding edge and aiming to beat my previous<00:03:02.159><c> version.</c><00:03:02.640><c> So,</c><00:03:03.519><c> when</c><00:03:03.760><c> I</c><00:03:03.920><c> talk</c><00:03:04.080><c> about</c> previous version. So, when I talk about previous version. So, when I talk about progressive<00:03:04.959><c> overload,</c><00:03:05.920><c> um</c><00:03:06.159><c> I</c><00:03:06.319><c> would</c><00:03:06.480><c> say</c> progressive overload, um I would say progressive overload, um I would say most<00:03:06.879><c> of</c><00:03:06.959><c> you</c><00:03:07.120><c> guys</c><00:03:07.280><c> know</c><00:03:07.440><c> what</c><00:03:07.599><c> that</c><00:03:07.760><c> is,</c><00:03:08.000><c> but</c> most of you guys know what that is, but most of you guys know what that is, but it's<00:03:08.480><c> essentially</c><00:03:09.599><c> every</c><00:03:09.840><c> time</c><00:03:10.080><c> you</c><00:03:10.239><c> go</c><00:03:10.400><c> to</c> it's essentially every time you go to it's essentially every time you go to the<00:03:10.720><c> gym,</c><00:03:11.280><c> you</c><00:03:11.440><c> want</c><00:03:11.599><c> to</c><00:03:11.760><c> try</c><00:03:11.840><c> to</c><00:03:12.000><c> beat</c><00:03:12.239><c> your</c> the gym, you want to try to beat your the gym, you want to try to beat your previous<00:03:12.879><c> self</c><00:03:13.120><c> in</c><00:03:13.360><c> some</c><00:03:13.599><c> way.</c><00:03:13.920><c> So,</c><00:03:14.400><c> this</c><00:03:14.640><c> is</c> previous self in some way. So, this is previous self in some way. So, this is still<00:03:14.959><c> my</c><00:03:15.280><c> second</c><00:03:15.599><c> warmup,</c><00:03:16.080><c> and</c><00:03:16.319><c> all</c><00:03:16.560><c> I'm</c> still my second warmup, and all I'm still my second warmup, and all I'm doing<00:03:17.040><c> is</c><00:03:17.280><c> just</c><00:03:17.519><c> getting</c><00:03:17.840><c> everything</c> doing is just getting everything doing is just getting everything activated,<00:03:19.280><c> getting</c><00:03:19.599><c> everything</c><00:03:20.080><c> warmed</c><00:03:20.400><c> up,</c> activated, getting everything warmed up, activated, getting everything warmed up, going<00:03:20.800><c> through</c><00:03:20.959><c> the</c><00:03:21.120><c> ranges</c><00:03:21.440><c> of</c><00:03:21.599><c> motion,</c><00:03:22.400><c> and</c> going through the ranges of motion, and going through the ranges of motion, and now<00:03:22.959><c> I</c><00:03:23.200><c> believe</c><00:03:23.440><c> that</c><00:03:23.599><c> this</c><00:03:23.760><c> will</c><00:03:23.920><c> be</c><00:03:24.000><c> my</c><00:03:24.239><c> first</c> now I believe that this will be my first now I believe that this will be my first working<00:03:24.800><c> set.</c><00:03:25.120><c> So,</c> working set.

Thanks to your magical phrase, compliment not consume, I changed my workouts to what you do. I'm 47, worked out over 30 years. 2 hours in the gym. Got results and it was fun but now seeing your routine, I changed mine to yours. I'm happier now, I have more time for other things, I feel great. Please don't change anything. If it ain't broke don't fix it. They don't like it, they can watch another person. My only request, not a complaint, is can you show us your ab routine and talk about sets and reps? Thank you again. You're genuine, not another telling us they discovered some new way of exercising. Simple, enjoyable, more time for other things, I look forward to the next workout instead of being tired and dreading it. Thanks again man!",

Very few people could stick to it, not because of the physical aspect, but the mental aspect. The first time you train, the feeling coming out of the gym is great, but the next time you go in, it's \"Oh, crap, I gotta do this again?\" I found that Lee Labrada's training worked best for me -- 3 exercises, 2 sets each, 6-8 reps, 1 minute rest between sets. For back he trained 3 sets per exercise. 2 day split/4 days per week. I found it to be a hybrid between Mike Mentzer and Steve Reeves with the intensity to match.",

The only difference is I put my leg day in the middle. I'm a big Dorian Yates fan, so I like this three day split approach. I also think you're spot on by saying if someone is just staring to do more sets to train the movement.  I like there no drama on your channel, just practical fitness advice. Thanks for sharing ❤",

          "text": "You are one of the very few Fitness Youtubers not treating your audience like either complete iditots or aspiring pro bodybuilders. I think most of us (your audience) are neither of that. I, for example, just like to work out and/or get fit, look strong and be healthy. \n\nI don't want to be occupied with fitness 24/7 with the goal of looking like a Sci/Fi mutant from outer space, lol. And i couldn't care less if my workout plan isn't as optimal according to the newest released study. I also don't care to turn my life upside down and be totally fatigued, just to squeeze out 1.5% more gains.\n\nI am not genetic gifted with superior recovery or athleticism in general, other than some youtubers who claim that fatigue management is just lazyness 😒. \nI need to be very careful with how much volume/Intensity i can put on my body. This is not coming from someone working out for a couple of months on and off. I train since 1994 and i realized over the years that (especially when you get older) the worst/stupid thing you can do (related to workouts at least) is to overtax your body. Because training without being fresh and accumulating more and more exhaustion (because you think you HAVE to soldier through this) doesn't get you anywhere. Eventually you HAVE to take  two or more weeks off, just to feel like a human again.\n\nIn the beginning i was trying to do super high volume workouts 6 times a week. And when my body became to tired (long before i made any progress) i didn't stop and gave my body the needed rest. No, i switched to another programm and the circle started again. Which was pretty stupid. But when everyone you read (there was no Youtube back then, only the magazines with articles about Workouts)  says you HAVE to do more and more and even more and then train harder and even harder next time, you never stop to learn to listen to your body. \nHeck, in the first 15 years, i had unlearned how it feels the train fresh and not tired. \n\nAs you say all the time, Bodybuilding as a long-term undertaking. We as humans are so wired to think short term that it is hard to do something when the result is years in the future.  still need to restrain myself once in a whille when i work out so i don't go full out, balls to the wall and destroy myself in a workout.\nI learned that the goal is NOT to train as hard as you can, but to train hard ENOUGH.\nIn my experience, right dosage of intensity, volume and rest time is the key. Not too much and not to little, do the RIGHT amount. The thing is most people who train to get strong/big do way too much. They often try to do workouts which where made by steroid users.\n\nThis is why i have unsubbed most of the Fitness Youtube channels i had for years, because i realized they either make videos for absolute beginners (train HARDER!!) or people who aim to be pro bodyybuilders (everything HAS to optimal on point.ALWAYS!!). \n\nI don't want to life like that and to be hones this is not fun anymore. \nI LOVE to train, it feels awesome and this is the only place where i feel peace and like a human (sounds funny, i know).\nI train for 35 years and i would love to continue doing this for the next 35 years and more, if i am allowed to.\n\nSorry for the rant, i don't know why i wrote that much. Sorry for that.",

Try starting this same shit when you're 45 and you'll have a different experience. \n\nLift hard, whether you go light or heavy, lift often and HARD, and do as much compound lifting as possible.  Bodybuilder lifting only gets results when you're juiced (frankly doing anything gets results when you're on gear), otherwise your stability muscle deficiencies will lead to injuries keeping you off the platforms.   The sixpack is made in the kitchen, not at the gym.  Anything else is absolute bullshit trying to sell you something.",

I can do 20 reps but honestly im not convinced the form is similiar enough to the point where I can count it as valid progressive overload, unlike more \"heavy\" exercises like shoulder press, rows etc(basically the compounds)\nLike how do u expect to progress on such a excericse where you've already reached a good weight I suppose, just expect to do the same weight?",

Because I'm going to start a PLP routine with only 6 sets per muscle group, and I don't know how much I'd be wasting my potential.\r\n\r\nI heard that the minimum number of sets is 10, and if you do it twice a week it's even better. And this is a bit far from what I plan to do, which would be to train 3 days a week (it's not realistic to fit 10 sets per muscle group into one day).",

          "text": "I'm on the A2J program for commercial gyms - I defo recommend picking it up. Eric doesn't specifically include neck work or much direct forearm work in it, but I can understand why, people are super limited on time for the core programme.  Its sometimes tough to fit them in timewise, but I want to work on it.  For forearms, I've added reverse curls with the bar before squatting. I no longer get wrist pain from squatting now - I guess it helps warm them up beforehand. Also doing some deadhangs and getting a bit from deadlifting too. Few years ago I injured my shoulder and my neck defo took a hit due to deferred pain, have been rehabing for a long time. I chose to add one neck exercise to each session e.g. neck curls, neck extensions and rotations with a band. Amazing how weak my neck curls are, I can only do around 3 sets of 25 - not even adding weight to it yet! Interesting that Eric is doing a much lower rep range, maybe I'll work toward that.\n\nAlso surprising to hear Mentzer didn't think direct work was so necessary - I can't see how the neck itself, as opposed to your traps, would get hit much by compounds? Forearms sure, people often make that case, but still think its helpful.",

But a herniated disc between C6-C7 prevents me from doing them. The neck muscles are critical especially now with all the forward head posture from cellphone use. The forearms are a different story. I've done wrist curls, had a homemade wrist roller I concocted as a teen. Built tremendous grip strength but the forearms just didn't grow. I'm genetically predisposed to small forearms.",

          "text": "So serious question with your style of training. You talk about the numbers going up and chasing prs and constantly looking at improving the weight but are your muscles growing ?? Most guys who want to get in shape and get a better body aren’t trying to improve numbers there trying to improve what they see in the mirror. You have shown pics before and other people have commented on the fact you don’t look any bigger. So is your physique staying the same due to muscle memory and some stimulus it’s getting but your numbers are going up ?? That sounds more like strength based training rather than hypertrophy. This isn’t an insult or taking shots at you am genuinely just baffled with how much conflicting advice there seems to be. A lot of people are promoting low volume training now a days but the thing is nobody who is promoting it built there body doing that style of training so what is the answer. I couldn’t really care about the numbers I want to look in the mirror and feel happy with what I see and have a muscular physique",

Since I’ve been inconsistent with the gym for the past 5+ years but recently got more disciplined, would it be smarter for me to follow your 3-day routine? I feel like it’s different for me since you already have a lot of muscle and I’m still skinny fat. Wouldn’t it be better for me to train 4 times a week instead — with Day 1 as chest + triceps, Day 2 as back + biceps, Day 3 as legs, and Day 4 as shoulders?\n\nI just want to stop feeling so bad about myself, feel more confident and finally get success with making friends and meeting women.",
